        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kalai Luu. I went to Downtown Magnet High School and am currently attending the University of California, Riverside as a first-year. As a first-generation student of a low-income family, no one is funding me for my education. Over the years, I have saved up money that I get on holidays, birthdays, surveys, etc. to work through my goals. College has given me the freedom that I have always wanted. I am independent, hard-working, honest, responsible, reliable and a quick learner. I am Bilingual in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. I am a certified Microsoft Office Specialist in Word and Excel. My weakness is that I lack confidence in myself. I am always underestimating myself. I have to think and worry whether the things I do and say might be dumb or not dumb. This prevents me from speaking up. As a result, it's hard for me to get along with others.<br><br>

        I never had a goal in life but during high school when I took AP Psychology I decided to major in psychology. In doing so, it will allow me to further my understanding of a personâ€™s brain, behavior, social, and development. This will allow me to pursue my future career and one day support my family. My goal is to become a social worker who works with children so that I can make a difference in the world, even if itâ€™s a little. Iâ€™ve worked with children by volunteering during high school which inspired me to work with them in the future. I have never traveled outside of the state for financial and personal reasons but my goal is to at least travel to two countries. <br><br>

        I have no work experience besides an internship at CSC that I did during the summer of my sophomore year. Iâ€™ve volunteered at an afterschool program as a tutor for a year. I have never volunteered for anything besides working with children. They taught me patience because it takes time for them to get to know you and trust you. Iâ€™ve always volunteered at Chinatown Summer Night and Los Angeles Chinatown library. I was very active during high school. I had an interest in photography and journalism so I joined the newspapers club in my junior and senior years. I also joined yearbook in my senior year. Iâ€™ve learned a lot from them. They taught me time management and determination. I also joined key club which taught me leadership and anime club. I was also a service worker for a teacher I was assigned. I helped grade homework and tests. I also helped teach some kids who were struggling in class the materials.
